Setting up a proper Jekyll feed

https://gist.github.com/roachhd/f664d2cae2da899be3f6

The standard feed address for a Jekyll website, using the jekyll-feed plugin, is /feed.xml. This is automatically generated when the plugin is installed and configured. If you've customized the feed path, it will be located at the path specified in your _config.yml file. 

Here's how to ensure your Jekyll website has an Atom feed:
1. Install the jekyll-feed plugin:
Add gem 'jekyll-feed' to your Gemfile. 
Add plugins: [jekyll-feed] to your _config.yml file. 
Run bundle install to install the gem. 

2. Verify the feed location:
If no custom path is specified, the feed will be at /feed.xml. 
If you've configured a custom path (e.g., feed: path: /blog/feed.atom), the feed will be at that location. 

3. Test your feed:
After building your site (e.g., with jekyll serve), navigate to the feed's URL in your browser. 

You can also validate your feed using the W3C Feed Validation service.
