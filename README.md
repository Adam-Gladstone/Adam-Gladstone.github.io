## About me
My name is Adam Gladstone. I am a software developer. I have a background in computer science and more than 20 years' experience developing desktop applications and components within a financial environment. This has involved coding on large-scale, complex software ecosystems. The majority of the development has been in C++, but I also have a good knowledge of C#/.Net and a
working knowledge of Python and R. I have experience working across the full development lifecycle from design to testing and delivery.

## I’m currently working on ...
- Office365 AddIns
  
  *Enabling functionality located in other libraries to be more accessible.*
  
- DietMonitorApp

  *An Android app that monitors the progress of your diet. Just enter your weight each day and track your weight loss!*

- FIXTools
 
  *A C# code generator that takes (Financial Information eXchange) FIX.xml specifications as input and generates a C++ constexpr FIX header library (that can be used to 'decode' FIX messages).*
        
- StatisticsLibrary

  *A C++ library of statistical functions (mean, var, sd, ...), tests (t-test, z-test, F-test ...) and analyses (time series, ... and in the future pca, lda).*

- NaturalLanguageProcessing 

  *A long-standing C# project that tests ideas in natural language parsing. Currently waiting to implement micro-grammars and chains.*

## I’m currently learning ...
- Mobile application development with Xamarin.Forms, XAML, .NET MAUI and C# on Windows 11 using Visual Studio 2022.
- WinRT (C++) for authoring COM-like components that can be consumed by UWP and WinUI applications (I have a couple of projects demonstrating these stacks: MediaCollectionWinUI and StatisticsViewer).
