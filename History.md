## A trip down memory lane ...

- 1984  
Bought a Commodore C16 from Dixons. A Christmas deal at Â£100.00. Went up to Tottenham Court Road and bought a (green screen) monitor. Began learning Commodore Basic.

- 1987  
Bought an Atari ST520. Got hold of an Alcyon C compiler/linker and a port of Emacs for the Atari (with source code). Started learning C (and some MC68000 assembly).

- 1993  
Bought a 80386 desktop PC (Dell) running Windows 3.1. Also bought [Visual C++ v1.0 Professional](http://www.emsps.com/oldtools/mscppv.htm#vcpp1) (big box delivered from Grey Matter, ~10 manuals, and 20+ diskettes plus a 286 Phar Lap extender). I started learning C++ 7.0, Windows programming and MFC 1.5.

- 1997  
Got a job as a software developer coding in C++. Still programming in C++, but also C#, Python and R.
