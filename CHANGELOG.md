## 28-10-2023
- Changed theme from 'dirt' to 'air'
- Updated link to R-bloggers
- Moved additional pages (About, History) into _pages subdirectory. These are indirectly linked via the masthead (`navigation.yml`) entries. For example, the entry: `url: /about/` references a file `about.md` located in the _pages directory.
- copied _sass into root directory; updated the font sizes.
- Updated bio.
